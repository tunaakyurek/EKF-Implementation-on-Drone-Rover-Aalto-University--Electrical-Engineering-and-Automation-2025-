# EKF Performance Improvements for Animated Obstacle Avoidance

## Problem Analysis

The original EKF implementation in `ekf_animated_obstacle_avoidance.m` was experiencing performance issues at turning points during the animated obstacle avoidance test. The main problems identified were:

1. **Simplified Jacobian Calculation**: The original implementation used a very basic linearization that didn't properly account for attitude dynamics during turns
2. **Inadequate Process Noise**: The process noise parameters were not properly tuned for maneuvering scenarios
3. **Missing Numerical Conditioning**: The original version lacked robust numerical conditioning to prevent divergence during aggressive maneuvers
4. **Poor Maneuver Detection**: No adaptive process noise based on maneuvering conditions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced EKF Implementation (`ekf_animated_obstacle_avoidance_improved.m`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Better Jacobian Calculation**: Implemented the robust Jacobian calculation from `calculate_F_sensor_only.m` that properly handles attitude dynamics during turns
- **Adaptive Process Noise**: Added maneuver detection and adaptive process noise scaling based on:
  - Angular rates (>30 deg/s triggers increased uncertainty)
  - Accelerations (>2 m/s² triggers increased uncertainty) 
  - Velocities (>3 m/s triggers increased uncertainty)
- **Robust Numerical Conditioning**: Added SVD-based covariance conditioning to prevent numerical issues
- **Enhanced Measurement Updates**: Improved numerical conditioning for GPS, barometer, and magnetometer updates

**Technical Details:**
```matlab
% Enhanced Jacobian with proper attitude dynamics
F = calculate_improved_jacobian(x, imu, dt);

% Adaptive process noise for maneuvers
Q = calculate_maneuver_process_noise(x, imu, dt, params);

% Robust covariance conditioning
P = condition_covariance(P);
```

### 2. Optimized Parameters (`parameters_animated_obstacle_avoidance.m`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Process Noise**: Increased velocity and attitude process noise for better maneuver tracking
- **Optimized Sensor Parameters**: Tuned sensor noise parameters specifically for obstacle avoidance scenarios
- **Maneuver Detection Thresholds**: Configured thresholds for detecting turning maneuvers
- **Numerical Conditioning Parameters**: Added parameters for robust numerical conditioning

**Process Noise Matrix:**
```matlab
params.Q = diag([
    0.02, 0.02, 0.02,           % Position uncertainty (m^2/s^2)
    0.15, 0.15, 0.18,           % Velocity uncertainty (m^2/s^4) - INCREASED
    0.08, 0.08, 0.10            % Attitude uncertainty (rad^2/s^2) - INCREASED
]);
```

### 3. Updated Test Implementation (`test_animated_obstacle_avoidance.m`)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated to use the improved EKF implementation
- Updated to use the optimized parameter set
- Added improved EKF update function
- Maintained all existing functionality and animation features

## Performance Improvements Expected

### 1. Better Turning Point Performance
- **Robust Attitude Estimation**: The improved Jacobian properly accounts for attitude dynamics during turns
- **Adaptive Uncertainty**: Process noise increases during maneuvers, allowing the filter to adapt to changing dynamics
- **Numerical Stability**: Enhanced conditioning prevents filter divergence during aggressive maneuvers

### 2. Improved Sensor Fusion
- **Better GPS Integration**: Enhanced numerical conditioning for GPS updates
- **Robust Barometer Updates**: Improved handling of altitude measurements during maneuvers
- **Stable Magnetometer Integration**: Better yaw estimation during turns

### 3. Enhanced Maneuver Tracking
- **Dynamic Process Noise**: Automatically increases uncertainty during detected maneuvers
- **Maneuver Detection**: Monitors angular rates, accelerations, and velocities to detect turning scenarios
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Filter behavior adapts to the current flight conditions
